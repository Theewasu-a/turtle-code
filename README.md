### Turtle Polygon Generator
This program uses Python’s turtle graphics to draw a random polygon and a smaller polygon inside it. The polygon’s size, color, orientation, and position are all randomly generated.

## How to Run
    1. Do not name the file turtle.py. Use a different name.
    2. Run the program: polygon.py

## Implementation Report
    Random polygon (3–5 sides) generates correctly
    Random color, border size, location, and orientation work
    Smaller polygon drawn using reduction ratio
    Rendering works after renaming file
    The only bug found:
        The program fails if the file is named turtle.py, because it conflicts with Python’s built-in turtle module.
